##Contributing

Before you contribute you need to:

1. `bundle install`

There are a couple of ways that you can contribute to Githubris. For example:

1. You can take a bug and verify the replication steps
2. You can take a verified bug and add acceptance criteria to a feature, so we
   have test coverage against it in the future.
3. You can take an unassigned feature and implement the tests and code to make
   them pass.
4. You can be part of a discussion on any of the Issues marked as a
   ```feature```
5. You can open pull requests to pull in your contributions
6. You can correct typos or grammar issues.
7. You can help in __any__ way you want!
